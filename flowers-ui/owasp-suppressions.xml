    <!--
    This file is for project-specific suppression of known CVE vulnerabilities in dependencies

    PLEASE NOTE: The nominal state of this file is to be *EMPTY* !

    Suppressions are centralized in the project luxtrust-common:luxtrust-owasp-suppressions managed by the security team
    Please contact them to assess the risk and to add a new suppression in the centralized file.

    Nevertheless it is allowed to *temporarily* add a suppression here to unblock a build while waiting for centralized
    update or in emergency (a CVE might appear unexpectedly at any time) but keep in mind that it is a security risk.
